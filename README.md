# Delta-Hedging

This project aims to provide a framework for implementing and evaluating delta hedging strategies for financial derivatives. Delta hedging is a risk management technique used by traders and market makers to reduce or eliminate the directional risk of an options portfolio.

### Introduction
Delta hedging involves adjusting the portfolio's positions in the underlying asset to offset the changes in the value of the derivative contract. By continuously rebalancing the portfolio, traders can maintain a delta-neutral position and minimize their exposure to directional price movements.

This project provides a set of tools and algorithms to implement delta hedging strategies in Python. It includes functions to calculate the delta of various options, simulate price movements, and optimize hedging parameters.
